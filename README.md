Worked on the Banglore home prices dataset from Kaggle to do predictive analysis of house prices using supervised ML algorithms
Cleaned the data, removed outliers and created data pipelines for predicting house prices according to parameters such as location, area, no. of bathrooms and bedrooms, etc.
Used GridSearchCV for finding the most optimal algorithm for prediction and for finding out the best parameters for predicition
